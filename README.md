Title: Appointment Scheduler
Purpose: Allows the scheduling of appointments with persistent information via an SQL database.
	Instructions for use of this software:
To access the features of this program, you must log in using a valid username and password from the database. Upon logging in, you'll receive an alert if there are any upcoming appointments within the next 15 minutes. Acknowledging this alert will bring you to the main screen that displays the Appointments List.
	Appointments Page:
Within the Appointments List view, you have the option to filter appointments by week, by month, or all time using radio buttons. The interface also includes options to add, update, or delete appointments, navigate to the Reports and Customers pages, or exit the application.
	Add Appointments Page:
Adding an appointment is straightforward; simply click the Add Appointment Button to be directed to the form where you can input necessary details through text fields and dropdown menus. After filling in the information, you can choose to save or cancel the action to return to the Appointments List.
	Modify Appointments Page:
Updating an appointment involves selecting the desired appointment from the list and clicking the Update button. This leads you to a form populated with the appointment's existing details, which you can modify. Saving or canceling these modifications are both options available to you.
	Customers Page:
The Customers section is accessible from the Appointments view and allows for the management of customer information, including additions, updates, and deletions. This section also provides navigation back to the Appointments view, access to Reports, or the option to exit the program.
	Add / Modify Customers Pages:
Adding or updating a customer involves similar steps to managing appointments, with forms provided for inputting or altering customer data. Saving these changes or canceling them will either update the database or return you to the previous view.
	Reports Page:
The Reports section offers insights into various aspects of the program's data, including contact interactions, login activity, geographic distribution of appointments, and monthly appointment statistics by type. This section is reachable from both the Appointments and Customers views. 
** My selection for the third report is a detailed view of geographic divisions, filterable by country, allowing the user to reference any specific division without it being linked to any specific entity.
